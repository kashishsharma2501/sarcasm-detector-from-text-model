# sarcasm-detector-from-text-model
This project is a machine learning-based sarcasm detector that predicts whether a given text (news headline) is sarcastic or not.

Key points
- Uses a dataset of 26,000+ headlines labeled as sarcastic or non-sarcastic.
- Includes **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)** to understand data distribution and vocabulary.
- Built and trained using a **BERT-based model** to capture contextual meaning.
- Achieves good accuracy by leveraging advanced NLP techniques.
- Provides a **Flask web app frontend** where users can input text and get predictions instantly.
  
Goal 
Help understand the subtle patterns of sarcasm in text, which is often challenging for machines due to its implicit and humorous nature.
